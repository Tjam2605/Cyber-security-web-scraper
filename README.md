# Cybersecurity Job Scraper

This repository contains a Python-based tool for scraping cybersecurity-related job listings using the JSearch API. The tool searches for jobs based on predefined keywords related to cybersecurity and saves the results into a CSV file. It is designed to help users find jobs based on specific search criteria, such as location, required skills, and experience level.

## Features

- **Keyword-based Job Search**: Searches for jobs using predefined cybersecurity-related keywords.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch) to retrieve job data.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the job results into a CSV file for easy data manipulation and sharing.
- **Random Delays**: Implements random delays between API requests to avoid potential rate-limiting or blocking.
- **Experience Filtering**: Filters jobs based on the required experience level (e.g., jobs requiring less than or equal to 24 months of experience).

## Predefined Keywords

The tool searches for jobs using the following keywords:

- Network Security
- Penetration Testing
- Incident Response
- Threat Intelligence
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Malware Analysis
- Risk Management
- Security Operations
- Encryption
- Identity and Access Management
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Firewall Management
- Cybersecurity Compliance
- Cloud Security
- Data Loss Prevention

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [fake_useragent](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/) (to rotate user-agent strings)
- [http.client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html) (for making HTTP requests)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) (to handle JSON responses)
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) (to write job data to CSV files)
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) (to handle random delays)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) (to generate random delay intervals)

To install the required dependencies, run e.g:

```bash
pip install fake_useragent

## Ethical Considerations

When using this tool, it is important to consider the following ethical guidelines to ensure responsible data scraping and respect for the terms of service of the websites and APIs you interact with:

### 1. **Respect API and Website Terms of Service**
   - Ensure that your usage of the JSearch API complies with its [terms and conditions](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch). Many websites and APIs limit how frequently you can access their data, and scraping outside of these limits can result in being blocked.
   - Do not overload APIs or websites with excessive requests. Be mindful of rate limits and use appropriate delays between requests, as implemented in this script.

### 2. **Data Privacy**
   - Respect the privacy of individuals and organizations by ensuring that scraped data is not misused or redistributed in ways that violate privacy agreements or laws such as the GDPR or CCPA.
   - Do not scrape personal or sensitive information unless you have explicit permission from the data owner or are authorized to do so.

### 3. **Non-commercial Use**
   - This tool is intended for educational and personal use. Do not use this tool for large-scale commercial purposes without properly evaluating the legal implications of scraping data from third-party sources.
   - Always verify with the data source if you intend to use the scraped data for purposes other than research or job searching.

### 4. **Transparency and Fair Use**
   - Be transparent about your usage of automated tools for data scraping, especially when interacting with third-party services.
   - Ensure that the scraped data is used in ways that benefit all parties, such as job seekers looking for employment, rather than exploiting the data for unfair advantages.

### 5. **Respect Intellectual Property**
   - Websites and services often have copyrights or intellectual property rights associated with their data. Be cautious about how you use the data and ensure that you're not violating intellectual property laws or terms.
   - Use the data responsibly and avoid redistributing it without proper attribution or permissions where required.

By following these ethical considerations, you can ensure that your usage of this tool is responsible, respectful, and in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
